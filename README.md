## Introduction

The following repository is maintained by Janzen Choi as part of his PhD candidature, supervised by Jay Kruzic, Ondrej Mur√°nksy, Luiz Borterlan Neto, and Mark Messner. The document contains code for the development and parameter optimisation of a microstructure-informed crystal plasticity model for the prediction of elevated-temperature creep.

### Generating an RVE in Neper

The following instructions are for developing an RVE, which uses lamellae to represent annealling twin structures.

1) Install Neper ([LINK](https://github.com/neperfepx/neper)).
2) Go to the directory where the code is located ([LINK](https://github.com/jazzzmannn/crystal_plasticity/tree/main/src/neper_gen)).
3) Open the script, `main.py`, and change the parameters based on the desired properties of the RVE.
4) Open the terminal and run the script via `python3 main.py`. This should create a bash file, `run.sh`.
5) Run the bash file via `./run.sh`.
